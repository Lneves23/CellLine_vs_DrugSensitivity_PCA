This Shiny app takes a list of cancer cell line specific IC50 values for a single drug candidate and returns an interactive principle component analysis (PCA) of compounds included in the GDSC database.

>CSV, XLS, and XLSX files are accepted

>An example input file is available for download

>The interactive graph can be scaled, filtered on minimum number of cell line and compound values and adjusted by PCA dimensions

>Summary data, including PCA cosine value, putative compound target, and target pathway, can be downloaded for selected points
